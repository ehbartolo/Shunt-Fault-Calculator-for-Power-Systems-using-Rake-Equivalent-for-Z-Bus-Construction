# Shunt-Fault-Calculator-for-Power-Systems-using-Rake-Equivalent-for-Z-Bus-Construction
ABSTRACT: a program written in MATLAB was created which can simulate non-simultaneous Three Phase Fault, Single Line to Ground Fault, Line to Line Fault, and Double Line to Ground Fault. It could be introduced with a fault impedance and can simulate change in symmetry. Its input can be edited on a spreadsheet and can analyze data such as generator, motor, line impedance, utility, 2 winding and 3 winding transformer. Phase shifts due to transformer configuration (e.g. Wye to Delta) is also incorporated in the program.
